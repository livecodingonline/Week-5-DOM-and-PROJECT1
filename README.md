## Week-6-DOM Manipulation
Hello everyone. Welcome to the 6th week of LiveCoding!

In this section there will be two main parts, one is introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM) and a project that wrap ups almost all we have learned so far. Next Week we will continue and finish DOM and further Javascript.

JS is going to be our core knowledge, thats why this week we will also solve simple JS tasks. It would be great if we can finish also this great and simple to follow [resource](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/).
